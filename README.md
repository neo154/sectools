# sectools
Extra security tools to latest update

Got tired of wanting or needing some cases of more up to date tools that is supported by the kali or parrot pacmanagers. Ontop of that these sometimes have different python library versions that mess other things up.

So this is just a way for me to manage it easier for me to manage those and give me a list of tools that I can use in some other cases.

Some just aren't included in OS, etc.

On top of that for python tools, this will also build a venv area for these to execute in isolation from the others. This slow things down a bit more, but nothing terrible for doing some security activities.
